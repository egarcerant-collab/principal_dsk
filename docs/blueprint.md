# **App Name**: JSON Insights Analyzer

## Core Features:

- File Upload: Allow users to upload a JSON file from their local machine.
- JSON Parsing: Parse the uploaded JSON file to extract the different fields and their values. Make this robust to handle various data types and structures.
- Data Visualization: Display the parsed JSON data in a structured format. Display a nested structure visually in a manner similar to JSONView-like expandable/collapsible lists.
- Field Summarization Tool: Employ an LLM to automatically summarize the key aspects of each top-level field. The LLM should analyze the types of data stored in a particular field and use that knowledge, if useful, to provide its summary.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D1C4E9) for a calm, analytical feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, to ensure readability and reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), a contrasting but harmonious color to highlight interactive elements and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying JSON data and code snippets.
- Use simple, monochrome icons to represent different data types and actions. Icons should be clear and easily recognizable.
- Use a clean, organized layout with clear separation between sections. The data visualization should be structured in a way that is easy to navigate.
